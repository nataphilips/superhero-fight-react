## `about the project`

Provides an opportunity to check which superhero or supervillain is stronger (with a fair share of luck for each :)).

Key statistics are: intelligence, strength and speed. 
Each supercharacter has a superpower which modifies values of these statistics of himself/herself or his/her opponent.

Pick a character by clicking on his/her picture and press Fight button. That's it! You'll see average damage dealt by each character and % of time that they dodged from rival's attacks.
Reset the fighting pair of characters by clicking on the portraits showing who is chosen, or just by clicking on Reset button.
